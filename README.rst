``groundhog``
=============

``groundhog`` is a silly proof-of-concept "microframework" implementation
based on `Pyramid <http://docs.pylonsproject.org>`_.  It is not to be taken
seriously, just a demonstration of the kinds of things you can do with
Pyramid.

Slightly out-of-date videos (made when Pyramid was called repoze.bfg) are
explaining how we created this are available from
http://bfg.repoze.org/videos#groundhog1 .
